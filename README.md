**COLLEGE ADMISSION PREDICTOR**

A website with a database with college admission criterias and previous cut off marks, that helps students predict which colleges are most likely to accept their admission applications. This project is hand-coded for students across the country who wish to have an insight on which colleges they would most likely be accepted into based on their rank in a given entrance exam or other preferences like location of the college and course they want to pursue.
